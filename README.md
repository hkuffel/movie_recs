# movie_recs
A content-based recommendation engine for a dataset of roughly 45,000 movies, considering the top-billed actors, director and a few plot keywords

The initial data comes from this Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). I've included the csv files that aren't too large here for convenience.
